# üì¶ Demand Forecasting with XGBoost for Inventory Management
This project implements a machine learning-based demand forecasting model using XGBoost. The model predicts product demand based on historical sales data and engineered features like lags, rolling means, promotions, and more.

üîç Key Features:
Preprocessed sales dataset with feature engineering

Demand prediction using XGBRegressor

Evaluation with MAE and RMSE

Feature importance analysis

Visualization of model performance

Model saving for deployment

This module can serve as a foundation for more advanced inventory management systems, including integration with reinforcement learning for dynamic replenishment strategies.
